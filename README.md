To Run the API tests you would need maven and java on your machine, just fork the repo.

Open in your IDE and then in IDE console run "mvn clean install" to import all the dependencies (They should auto import anyway)

All the tests are in test package thats only page you would need to run the tests

Config contains api endpoints to use throughout the framework

Baseclass includes some basic functions needed for this particular framework 

Pages package includes all the methods for test so they might need small parameter changes if you rerun few post and delete requests
